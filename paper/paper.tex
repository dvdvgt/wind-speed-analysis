% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% This command actually creates the footnote in the first column
% listing the affiliations and the copyright notice.
% The command takes one argument, which is text to display at the start of the footnote.
% The \icmlEqualContribution command is standard text for equal contribution.
% Remove it (just {}) if you do not need this facility.

%\printAffiliationsAndNotice{}  % leave blank if no need to mention equal contribution
\printAffiliationsAndNotice{\icmlEqualContribution} % otherwise use the standard text.

\begin{abstract}
Put your abstract here. Mention, in two sentences, what you are planning to work on. 
Then, mention which dataset you are planning to use. Include \href{https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G02135/south/daily/data/}{a link} to the dataset you are planning to use (If you are planning to collect your own data, explain how you are going to do so). If possible, mention (one sentence) how you came across this dataset, or why you decided to do this. Explain what kind of analysis you are planning. Finally, declare which results your are expecting to achieve. Your entire abstract should be at most 20 lines long.
\end{abstract}

We will use mostly this same template for the project report, potentially with some minor updates.

\section{Contribution Plan}

Explain here, in one sentence per person, what each group member is going to contribute. For example, you could write: Max Mustermann is going to collect and prepare data. Gabi Musterfrau and John Doe will run the data analysis. Jane Doe is responsible for visualizations. All authors will jointly write the text of the report. Note that you, as a group, a collectively responsible for the report. Your contributions should be roughly equal in amount and difficulty.
